# CORS Exploit Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides an overview and usage instructions for the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) exploit code.

### Purpose

The CORS exploit code demonstrates a vulnerability in web applications that improperly handle CORS policies, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive data from a different origin.

## Code Description

The provided HTML code snippet contains a modern UI using Bootstrap from a CDN and an "Exploit" button that performs the CORS exploit.

### HTML Structure

- The HTML structure consists of a Bootstrap-styled card containing the exploit button and a result display area.

### JavaScript Functionality

- The JavaScript code defines an event listener for the "Exploit" button.
- When clicked, the button triggers an XMLHttpRequest to the target URL with a malicious origin header.
- The response, including headers and body, is logged to the console and displayed in the result area.

## Usage

To use the CORS exploit code:

1. Replace `<Target Link>` in the JavaScript code with the URL of the target endpoint vulnerable to CORS misconfiguration.
2. Host the HTML file on a web server or open it in a web browser.
3. Click the "Exploit" button to trigger the CORS exploit.
4. View the response data and headers in the browser console and the result display area.

### Notes

- Ensure that you have explicit permission to test the target endpoint for security vulnerabilities.
- Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
- Use the exploit responsibly and for educational purposes only.
